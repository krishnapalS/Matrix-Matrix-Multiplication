<h2>Tiled Matrix-Matrix Multiplication</h2>
It is an algorithm for matrix multiplication in which threads collaborate to reduce global memory traffic. Using this algorithm, multiple accesses to the global memory for fetching the same data is avoided.
<p>Tiling helps increase the performance by using a device shared memory</p>
